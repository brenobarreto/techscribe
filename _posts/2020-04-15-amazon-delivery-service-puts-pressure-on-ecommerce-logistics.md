Amazon launched its delivery service in February 2018. The message was clear: Jeff Bezos's company saw express delivery (next day and same day modalities) as a business opportunity. And he was no longer willing to leave this opportunity in the hands of others.

This movement, like all the movements made by Amazon, had a series of immediate impacts on the global market. One of the most important ones was the cannibalization of the American logistics market. In less than two years, Amazon has captured almost 20% of the United States e-commerce delivery market, causing historic companies like FedEx and UPS to lose huge amounts of money overnight.

Since the launch of the Amazon service, FedEx's value has fallen by 39%, or $25 billion. It's no wonder that there is talk of a likely FedEx sale within the next two years - with a good chance that the buyer will be Walmart.

## Risk and opportunity

For the e-commerce ecosystem as a whole, this movement creates more and more pressure on store logistics every day. 

To remain competitive, stores are increasingly forced to do next day and same day delivery. For now, this pressure is more evident in the U.S., but it won't be long before it grows in other markets as well. Today, half of deliveries of Amazon products worldwide are already fulfilled by the company itself.

This pressure, on the other hand, can be seen as an opportunity (for e-commerce stores who notice this movement early and work soon to be part of it). 

The know-how acquired by Amazon has caused several of its employees to leave the company in recent years in order to found their own logistics companies. And with that, new delivery service alternatives have been spreading throughout the American e-commerce ecosystem.

This multiplication of services has the potential to democratize the express delivery and leverage the operation of early adopters.
