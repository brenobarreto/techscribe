Did you know that today only 2.7% of purchases in Latin America take place online? 

I believe that, for those who are immersed in the ecommerce market, it is always beneficial to do the exercise of thinking about numbers like this. It reminds us that, despite everything online stores have conquered so far, the size of the market opportunity that e-commerce represents is still huge. 

If 97.3% of purchases still don't take place online in a subcontinent as big as Latin America, imagine the height of the ramp that the e-commerce will climb in the coming years - especially considering the fact that the young audience - for whom the internet is nothing less than the standard - is, as we speak, becoming the generation who makes purchasing decisions.

One of the most important consequences of this is the following: the people and businesses who are investing in ecommerce right now, and learning to do it right, are getting prepared to reap much greater fruits than we can imagine today.

It's like the stock market, where you anticipate future movements and invest 100 dollars hoping to have a return of 1,000 dollars. And just as in the stock market, your current investments in the e-commerce market need to be based on knowledge.
