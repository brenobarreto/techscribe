There is a word that should be a mantra for everyone who works with ecommerce: **context**. 

Today's customer expects a customized experience, and to offer this the store needs mechanisms that capture the context of this customer:

- How old is she or he?
- What is their gender?
- Have they ever bought at your store?
- Where do they live? 
- Which browser are they using when they access your site?

The list of possible questions is much bigger than this, and the more answers you have, the better prepared you are to offer a **customized experience**. And customized experiences greatly increase your chance of bringing sales home.

But what does that have to do with price? Well, the **price** is one of the variables that you can manipulate according to the customerâ€™s context.

Imagine, for example, that your pricing strategy is based, among other factors, on the logistical cost of delivering your products across the country. This cost needs to be reflected in the final price of the product + shipping.

The location of your Distribution Center allows you to offer free shipping to an entire region of the country. For the other regions, you need to charge freight. And this impacts your communication. Instead of simply saying in your marketing campaign that shipping is free, you need to include the observation that this applies only to a specific region.

Now imagine that you could embed the shipping cost in the product price, but only for customers from regions other than the one where you have your Distribution Center.

To do that, your store's website would need to identify the customer's region when accessing the store and then understand that, for this customer, prices are different.

Instead of a standard pricing table, you would have **two or more pricing tables**, each for a specific context. And just as it's possible to have multiple prices by location, you could differentiate prices by any other contexts, as long as they could be identified.

Not all ecommerce platforms have this feature. But if yours do, consider incorporating it into your pricing strategy.
