extract: "Thinking about the slice of visits to your site that turn into purchases only makes sense after you actually have visits. Focus on traffic before spending months optimizing your website to improve the conversion rate."

There is a “magic” number in e-commerce, which is the market **average conversion rate**. 

In most countries, this number is around **1.5%**.

This means that, on average, **e-commerce stores sell 1 and a half products every 100 visits on the website**. That is, if your store is average, to sell 1 product, you need about 70 visits. To sell 10 products, you need 700 visits. To sell 100, you need 7 thousand visits. And so on - you get the picture.

Then I see a lot of people who just went live racking their brains to figure out how to increase the number of sales, but without really considering this fairly simple math.

This is a huge mistake for any beginner. Because this math proves something fundamental for the survival of any e-commerce, anywhere in the world: 

>Before thinking about conversion, focus on traffic! 

Why? 

Well, let's say your website is super optimized. The usability is excellent, the performance is awesome, the price is competitive, etc. 

With all that, you achieved something incredible: your conversion rate is 6%. Wow, you have quadrupled the average conversion rate in the market. Congratulations, this is not something easy to do.

However, despite this incredible result, if you have 5 visits to your site per day, such an amazing conversion rate will give you 0.3 products per day, or 9 products per month. And I guess you haven't entered the e-commerce business to sell 9 products a month. 

So, before building an ultra-optimized store, make sure you deliver a good product, with quality service, but in a way that's simple enough to make it **grow fast**. 

As the great <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1250061898671947777" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> said in a recent tweet:
>"[For startups], slowness is way more likely to be due to inability than prudence. The startups that do things slowly don't do them any better. Just slower."

After assuring that you have a simple but real business running - ie, one that has implemented the necessary channels and tools to bring traffic - focus on doing just that: **bringing traffic to your store**.

When you have 100, 1000, 10 thousand visits per day, then it will make a real difference if you find ways to increase your conversion. Only then those 0.1% more in the conversion rate will bring you a volume of new sales that justifies the optimization effort.
