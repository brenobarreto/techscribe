Those who are familiar with digital channel analysis tools are used to the **bounce rate** metric. The bounce rate informs the percentage of sessions in which the user reached a page on the site and then left without visiting any other page or taking any other action, such as clicking a button or playing a video.

In many cases, this behavior means the user actually “rejected” what they found (that's why in some languages bounce rate is literally translated as "rejection rate"). For example, if you're analyzing a certain product page from your e-commerce, and Google Analytics tells you that the bounce rate for that page was 70% in the last month, it's because in 70% of the sessions, users who entered your site through that page during that time left without visiting any other page or taking any other action.

Since they did not even visit the shopping cart, it makes sense to infer that they “rejected” the product (although you also need to consider users who, for example, were doing a search navigation - and who will possibly come back to finish the purchase later).

Now, instead of a product page, let's look at a company help desk page that explains how to perform a certain action. In this case, **the bounce rate cannot necessarily be interpreted as a metric of failure**.

Imagine, for example, that the bounce rate for that specific page in the last month is 50%. Again, what this means is that half of the people who came to your site from that page left the site without visiting any other or taking any action. Did these users leave frustrated? With the bounce rate data alone, it's impossible to know.

It may be that most of them actually entered the page, read the post, were happy with what they learned and left, knowing more about the subject and admiring your brand a little more than before. Mission accomplished, with or without bounce.

This is true because the bounce rate is not necessarily related to the time spent on the page or the task accomplished during the visit. The user may have spent twenty minutes on the page and read each and every word. If they have not visited any other page on the site or performed any clear action, this session is still counted as a bounce.

By the way, this is one of the reasons why it's clever to set up events in your page. The more events you have configured, such as scrolling, the easier it will be to spot actions performed by the user, even if they stay in the same page.
