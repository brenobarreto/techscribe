The concepts of product and SKU are ubiquitous in the ecommerce market, but their definition is not always clear. Depending on the platform you use or even the person you talk to, the interpretation of what product and SKU mean can vary slightly. 

So, let's define these two concepts and understand the real difference between them.

## Product

Product is what the end customer sees in the store window. In other words, it's **what you communicate to them as the thing to be purchased**, regardless of possible variations of size, flavor, voltage, etc.

For example: in general, it would not make sense for customers to see these products side by side in the store window: Shirt Awesome S and Shirt Awesome M. Although the sizes vary, both are the same **product**.

The same way, it would not make sense for you to create a marketing campaign for the 110v Samsung Top Refrigerator and another campaign for the 220v Samsung Top Refrigerator.

In all communication with the customer, we ignore these variations, because we are dealing with the product.

## SKU

The **SKU**, on the other hand, is the specific unit of each product present in stock. The acronym SKU, indeed, stands for **Stock Keeping Unit** and comes from logistical storage management. Its concept is useful in several contexts, one of the most common being inventory control.

From the point of view of stock, it is essential to know how many units the store has of the Shirt Awesome S and also of the Shirt Awesome M. Just as it is essential to track the life cycle of each of these SKUs. 

So in this case you definitely want to treat them individually, as units with a life of their own. Each of the SKUs of a same product will have a specific identification number to allow this individual tracking. 

But the SKU also appears in the cart, because that is where the store usually offers their customers the opportunity to choose which variation of the product they want. Following the example of the refrigerators, the customer chooses the product in the window and sees the details of the product on the product page. But when they get to the cart, they need to choose between the 110v and 220v refrigerator. In other words, they need to choose the SKU they you will actually buy.

## How to deal with these concepts

Sometimes you will not have variations of a product. For example, in a jewelry store, each product may be unique, with no differentiation in size or any other, in which case each product will correspond to an SKU. No problem at all.

Other times, a product will be associated with several SKUS. For example, in a cosmetics store there may be an enamel with dozens of colors, each corresponding to a different SKU. No problem either.

It all depends on how you are going to build your catalog architecture. And to decide this, always consider the customer experience.
