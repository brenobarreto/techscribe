Why is there so much talk about performance in the internet? Why does your site's website need to be fast? Why is it important to quickly load your homepage, your category pages, posts, etc.? 

Because **the internet user is one of the most impatient beings you've ever known**. 

Some researches show that a 2 second increase in the loading time of the pages of a website lead to an increase of up to 100% in the bounce rate.

That is, **2 more seconds of loading your site's content can double your bounce rate**.

And what are the factors that make your site's performance drop? 

There are many possible reasons. But one of the most common performance villains is also one of the simplest problems to solve: the excessive size of the images.

Even in big and professional brands, we often see sites that, for example, put 300x300 pixels images on the frontend, and - when we investigate the actual size of these images, we realize they have an actual size of 1000x100 pixels. That is, the stositere is loading an image of 1000 by 1000, but at the time of rendering this image for the customer, it's reducing it to 300 by 300.

The problem is: 
>What matters for the page load time is the actual size of the image.

How to solve this? Simple: find out the size your images are being rendered in and compress them all to that size. With that, they will be rendered in their actual size, without unnecessary reductions. This will bring performance gain to your site and, as a consequence, will improve your conversion rate.
