The concept of **Lead Time** can be defined by the time elapsed between the beginning of a process and the end of that process. In e-commerce logistics, when we refer to the lead time, we are usually talking about one of these three contexts: 
- **Delivery lead time**: the time between the moment an order is placed and the moment the order is delivered to the end customer;
- **Production lead time**: the time between the moment the store requests the manufacture of a product and the moment when that product arrives at the store's inventory;
- **Stock lead time**: the time elapsed between the moment the product enters the stock and the moment when this product is sold and therefore comes out of stock.

Why is it important to think about these concepts? Because they help you find the balance between fast delivery and healthy stock levels. 

Let's look at some example scenarios to better understand what lead time is.

1. You sell T-shirts and just received an order. As the t-shirt is personalized, it still needs to be manufactured. Then your **total lead time** will be formed by:
- **Production lead time**: the time that your supplier takes to receive your manufacturing order, make the product and then deliver it to your stock; 
- **Delivery lead time**: the time between the moment this product leaves your stock and the moment it arrives at the customer's address.

2. You sell cell phone cases. Currently, there are 300 units of the XPR11 model in stock. Your Purchasing area needs you to ask the supplier for more. In the last 6 months, your store has sold an average of 100 units of this model per month. So your expectation is that the stock will last 3 months. You know that stock that's just sitting in the warehouse costs money, so you don't want to order new SKUs for nothing. So, in this case, the **production lead time** needs to be considered. If this case model comes from China and it takes 3 months between the time your store places an order with the supplier and the time the product arrives at your stock, it's probably time to order more units indeed. But if the supplier is a factory next door and it can manufacture and deliver in 5 business days, it may be worth waiting to place a new order. 

3. You sell balcony furniture. Your team did an analysis of the **stock lead time** over the last year and found that it was 90 days. This means that, on average, each product that arrives from suppliers to the stock is kept in stock for 90 days until finally being sold and delivered. This should be an alarming data for your operation. Imagine a stockpile full of tables and couches that need to wait 90 days until they can leave. This means that the value invested in these products is at a standstill, while the bills to bear the costs of keeping them stored continue to arrive.
