How many buttons does your customer need to press from the moment they decide to buy a product until the moment they complete the purchase? How many fields do they need to fill? How much information do they need to read?

Each of these steps is an **extra task** that you transfer to the customer. It's work they have to do. And no internet user likes working to buy something. They want your store to do the tasks for them; they want to be served, and fast.

Offering a checkout with as few steps as possible means reducing the friction between the customer and the store. And reducing this friction means decreasing the number of **cart abandonments**, which in turn leads to an increase in your conversion rate. 

According to the [Baynard Institute](https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate), the average cart abandonment rate in ecommerce is approximately 70%. That is, 7 out of 10 users who arrive at your store cart, at the moment they are about to pay for the order, simply abandon the purchase.

Now imagine if, in front of this user, who is extremely lazy and prone to leave your site without closing the purchase, you start asking for information such as ID, home phone, the full name of their mother... 

Or imagine if this user needs to go through four different screens before being able to close the purchase: one to enter the address, another to read return information, another for payment , and one more for confirmation. The chance of this user abandoning the purchase increases with each step, each form, each button.

So if you have to choose between getting more information from the customer and reducing the checkout steps, choose to **reduce the checkout steps** in almost every scenario. Hardly any information will be worth more than the conversion increase you will achieve with this simple change. And if your e-commerce platform provides the option of checking out without the need for a password, even better!
